        <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>
        <p>
            he greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, Leonhard Euler was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant<br> of mathematics,
            Jean Bernoulli. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler<br> was the most prolific mathematician 
            of all time, publishing over 800 different books and<br> papers. His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well. Euler's work on mathematical analysis, 
            Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748) remained a standard textbook for well<br> over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote Lettres a une 
            princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772), giving a clear non-technical<br> outline of the main physical theories of the time.

            One can hardly do math without copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such as e and pi, were introduced in Euler's writings. He is perhaps<br>
            best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's formula
        </p>
    
        <p>cos(x) + isin(x) = e<sup>(ix)</sup></p>
        <p>demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive the equation</p>
        <p>e<sup>(&prod;<i>i</i>) + 1</sup> = 0</p>
    
    which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, &prod;, e, and i in a single beautiful and elegant statement.<br>
    
    Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.
